# FACEBOOK TAB BOILERPLATE

This is a simple boilerplate I created to develop Facebook Tabs. These tabs are usually pretty simples, so styles and scripts are embedded directly in the document to avoid additional requests. jQuery is fetched from Google's CDN, with a local fallback.

Usually all images and js files are hosted on an external server.
